# Salifort-Employee-Retention-Model
This project was a case study given to me during the final period of the Google Advanced Data Analytics professional certificate of Coursera. The objective was to analyze the data of a CSV file obtained from Kaggle to create a machine learning using the PACE workflow for a fictional company to help them determine whether an employee will leave or stay and save money that would be used to search for replacements.
